# Resume Placeholder

This is a placeholder file. Please replace this with your actual PDF resume.

To add your PDF resume:

1. Save your resume as "resume.pdf"
2. Place it in the same directory as your index.html file
3. The download link in your portfolio will automatically work

Your resume file should be named exactly: **resume.pdf**

The current download button in your portfolio links to this file:
```html
<a href="resume.pdf" download="Nuwahereza_Peter_Resume.pdf" class="btn btn-primary">
```

Make sure your PDF resume includes:
- Contact information
- Professional summary
- Education
- Skills
- Experience
- Projects
- Any relevant certifications

For best results, keep your resume to 1-2 pages and use a clean, professional format.
